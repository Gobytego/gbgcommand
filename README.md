# gbgcommand
GBGCommand - a GUI way to run some of my scripts - originally made for friends/family who are scared of the terminal 

to install the .deb file first download it.
next open the terminal and move to the folder where you downloaded the .deb to.
then run 

sudo apt install ./gbgcommand_1.0.deb

(take note the version number)

First time running this utility please run the "Update this app" script from the menu to download all the other scripts or nothing will work.
  will fix this in future releases.
  
will add .desktop file in future releases to be able to launch this from menus.
